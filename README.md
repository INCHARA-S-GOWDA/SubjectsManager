# SubjectsManager 
In this project we’ll address one of the many issues faced by students i.e, MANAGING
DIFFERENT SUBJECTS .The objective of the SUBJECTS MANAGER is to organize
multiple subjects in order ,so that it reduces the burden on student to keep track of the
subjects to be studied and the subjects that has already been studied. Here, I have used
the concepts of Web Technologies namely HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

The outcomes are :
• The satisfaction of completing a task\n
• Good comments from teachers
• Being perceived as successful by your peers or parents
• Long-term success, i.e. top grades and a place at your university of choice.

THIS PROJECT IS CREATED BY INCHARA S GOWDA, 
BACHELOR OF ENGINEERING STUDENT,
SJB INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY.
